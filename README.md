# Bike-Sales-Dashboard
Bike Sales Dashboard

The project's aim is to provide insights into our customer base and help us make informed decisions about our bike sales strategies by answering the following questions:

-Which region has the highest bike sales?
-Is there a correlation between the distance a person commutes and the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
-Which occupation types are more likely to purchase a bike?
-Which gender is more likely to purchase a bike?
-What is the average income of bike purchasers?
-What is the relationship between education level and bike purchases?
